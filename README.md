[!frontpage](images/frontpage.png)

## Introduction
A stock screener uses a set of metrics to decide on which companies to invest in to predict the best possible return on investments. The screener this project is based on is called `Option 2: General Screening Instructions` and is an extended generalization of the main algorithm of the book `The Little Book That Beats the Market` by Joel Greenblatt that can be used without the books dedicated [stock screener website](https://www.magicformulainvesting.com/).

The philosophy behind this screener is to find a set of companies that on average trades at a bargain price relative to their true value. This is done with a margin of safety as the companies generally earn well compared to their cost with little debt and is further improved by spreading the portfolio over 20-30 stocks over a year. It is not only interested in the companies with the current greatest earnings to investment ratio but also companies that are good in the sense that they likely grow over time.

Crawling is the process of obtaining the metrics needed to perform a prediction algoriithm. This can be done by API for publically available financial sites, such as Morningstar or Yahoo finance. In this project we will be using Python for both the screener and the crawler parts.
